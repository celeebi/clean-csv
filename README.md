# clean-csv


first of we download the zip file using gdown from pypi package, we can install it simply with `pip install gdown`

download it with `gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1rKkUQU-sXIDka3rVNBahp6q3wDhrPY-1`
not going to show the file here, you can check it by yourself since i cant upload more then 100mb, so that includes the extracted and cleaned file

in the script we start with stacking both 2 files from the link after we extract it with unzip,

after that i started to format the data trying to match the expected outcome, but i havent got any notion on
how to split the category code so ill leave it at that, 

i use a separate script for the cleaning data, and to show the csv in table form, since it will be easier to alter in the future for the un-tabled script
